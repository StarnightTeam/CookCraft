# CookCraft

*Welcome to the GitHub repository for CookCraft!*


This is where you'll report issues, make suggestions, etc. outside of the CurseForge comments section and [discord server](https://discord.gg/EART3XcyZm).

The files in here will be the configs, default configs, scripts, changelogs, custom item textures, and a few random development notes.

*If you would like to provide translations or textures for any of the custom items, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/StarnightTeam/CookCraft/pulls) or tell us on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/EART3XcyZm)*
