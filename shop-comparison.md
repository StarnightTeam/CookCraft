# AdminShop
+ easier to configure and manage since it uses a KubeJS script
+ allows you to restrict items with permits, which can be used to enforce progression or lock higher-end items. Permits are just an item with NBT data, so it can be given as a crafting recipe, quest reward, etc.
+ easy to use and has shortcuts to buy/sell a quarter of a stack or entire stack of items at once (also shift+click to quick-sell items from your inventory - even if you're on the "buy" tab)
+ supports decimal amounts (e.g. $2.50)

± needs a physical block to access



# SDM Shop
+ lets you set limits on each entry (e.g. you can buy a nether star, but only thrice). Said limits can also be "global", which i assume applies to the entire server but it doesn't say
+ lets you create multiple (seemingly infinite?) categories
+ lets you restrict categories and entries behind a certain quest
+ accepts items in shop entries
+ lets you make entries for commands, advancements, etc. You can even let players buy & sell quests lol.

± can be accessed at any time
± seems like you can't configure the money (either its name or icon)

- a bit annoying to create new entries
- using the shop is a tad annoying due to the UI being a tad janky
- tag entries don't cycle through items like in AdminShop, so you have to manually check all the accepted items
